Hi There Again....
In this part we will clone our code from repo to local...
What we need to do ?
We need to traverse backward and create a empty directory..
1. cd .. ---> Will back one step, do it until you reach the drive.
2. mkdir GitLearning ---> Create a new folder GitLearning.
3. cd gitlearning ---> Will open and go inside the folder.
4. git clone https://github.com/Ratul-Tester/LearningGit.git ---> Will clone everything from repo to local.
5. ls ---> To check the clonned items in new folder i.e., GitLearning
After doing these all you can create new files inside the new folder and push it again to the repo....
