Hi There,
Here we will learn some git codes regarding creating a Branch...
Switching to a Branch....
fetching and pushing items into newly created branch from local to repo...
After creating a branch we need to do the following:-
1. git fetch ---> To fetch all the items.
2. git branch -a ---> To see all the branches.
3. git checkout -b feature1 ---> To switch into a new branch named feature1, which is present locally.
4. git push --set-upstream origin feature1
